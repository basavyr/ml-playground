# ML Playground 🚀

A collection of tools used for learning Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network concepts

## November 2025 Update

The [`benchmarks/`](./benchmarks/) folder includes new implementations that are useful for testing the compute capabilities of different GPUs and accelerators.

Several key architectures are studied and measured in terms of training & inference performance:
- deep neural networks
- convolutional neural networks
- transformers (decoders only)
